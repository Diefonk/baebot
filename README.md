# BaeBot
A simple Discord bot with some stupid commands.

## Requirements
To run this bot locally you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), or you can do like me and host it on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). [Here's a nice guide](https://anidiotsguide_old.gitbooks.io/discord-js-bot-guide/content/other-guides/hosting-on-glitchcom.html), and [here you can see my bot hosted on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/baebot).  
You will also need to put your bot's token somewhere, on line 3 in BaeBot.js the token imports from a file named token.json (not in this repository), but you can put it wherever you want, as long as you keep it hidden.
